# TestRunner Hints

This file provides additional context to the LLM for better test analysis.
Copy this to `HINTS.md` and customize it for your project.

## Project Overview

Describe your project's purpose and architecture here. This helps the LLM
understand the codebase structure and make better predictions about which
tests might be affected by code changes.

## Critical Paths

List the most important parts of your codebase:

- `src/auth/` - Authentication system, changes here affect many tests
- `src/api/` - API endpoints, high test coverage
- `src/database/` - Database models and queries

## Known Flaky Tests

List tests that are known to be unreliable:

- `tests/test_network.py::test_timeout` - Occasionally fails due to network issues
- `tests/test_async.py::test_race_condition` - Timing-dependent

## Test Dependencies

Describe any external dependencies your tests require:

- Database: Tests require a PostgreSQL connection
- Redis: Some tests use Redis for caching
- External APIs: Mock services are used for third-party integrations

## Additional Context

Add any other information that would help the LLM understand your testing setup:

- We use pytest fixtures extensively
- Integration tests are in `tests/integration/`
- Unit tests are in `tests/unit/`
